Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 21497976225 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 21497976225 samples is 257.96, and randomly
would exceed this value 43.64 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4993 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141646406 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000005 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
