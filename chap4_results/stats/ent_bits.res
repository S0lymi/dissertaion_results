Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 171983809800 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 171983809800 samples is 0.01, and randomly
would exceed this value 93.05 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5000 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141646406 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000000 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
