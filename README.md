# Statistical testing results for measurements of chapters 3 and 4 of the dissertation titled "Post-processing techniques for time-of-arrival based quantum random number generators".

The outputs of different test batteries can be found in the "name-of-the-battery".res files under the "stats" directories.

Output files of the NIST STS are contained in separate directories for each test case since the suite outputs multiple result files.

For the case of results for Chapter 4, the sts suite was utilized 10 times on different disjunct bit sequences. These results are contained under the "sts_splits" directory with the last two numbers of the subdirectories noting the different test cases.


Additionally, this repository also contains the dissertation pdf for reference.
