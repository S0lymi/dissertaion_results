Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 7780423680 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 7780423680 samples is 8.53, and randomly
would exceed this value 0.35 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5000 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141704448 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000059 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
