Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 972552960 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 972552960 samples is 392.28, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4963 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141704448 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000005 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
