Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 486276480 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 486276480 samples is 286.78, and randomly
would exceed this value 8.35 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5008 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141437118 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000001 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
